    <p padding-left:24px class="Front_Page_Txt">I'm a self-taught programmer, with experience in a variety of languages such as LUA, C#, C++, Java, HTML, and others.
    In my sprea time I enjoy making things in UE4 as well as modeling hard surface objects. I have a dream game I want to make one day.

	<p class="Walrus_Dreams"> I really like walruses, they're my favorite animal. I even made some walrus games before in Unity, I know they aren't well designed.
	I think someday I will try to go back and improve them. <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/walrus-tusk-boxing/67166">Walrus Tusk Boxing</a> would probably be the first.
	I made before that <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/walrus-santa/111133">Walrus Santa</a> which makes more sense to me than Santa being a person. It would be miserable
	living in such a cold place your whole life if that was me. But I guess people do, so I shouldn't criticize. Last, currently "released" is <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/j-rope/58354"> J-Rope</a></p>

	<p>But for today, I am a freelance HTML Web developer looking for work. I also in my spare time am helping with <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/546610" >Acro Storm</a> which is on Steam. One of the things I've learned
	through making all the games I have is how to make models for computers. I'm not that great at it, my main weakness is still probably making textures.	</p>
