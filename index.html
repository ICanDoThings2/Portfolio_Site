    <p padding-left:24px class="Front_Page_Txt">I'm a self-taught programmer, with experience in a variety of languages such as LUA, C#, C++, Java, HTML, and others.
    In my spare time I enjoy making things in UE4 as well as modeling hard surface objects. I have a dream game I want to make one day.

	<p class="Walrus_Dreams"> I really like walruses, they're my favorite animal. I even made some walrus games before in Unity, I know they aren't well designed.
	I think someday I will try to go back and improve them. <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/walrus-tusk-boxing/67166">Walrus Tusk Boxing</a> would probably be the first.
	I made before that <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/walrus-santa/111133">Walrus Santa</a> which makes more sense to me than Santa being a person. It would be miserable
	living in such a cold place your whole life if that was me. But I guess people do, so I shouldn't criticize. Last, currently "released" is <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/j-rope/58354"> J-Rope</a></p>

	Did you know there was a walrus who lived nearly 30 years in captivity? His name was ET the walrus.
	He lived at Point Defiance Zoo since his infancy, and is actually in different films and movies as his vocal recordings, such as Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare as some zombie sounds.
	He sadly passed away not long ago, due to a throat infection. He will dearly be missed.

	<p>But for today, I am a freelance HTML Web developer looking for work. I also in my spare time am helping with <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/546610" >Acro Storm</a> which is on Steam. One of the things I've learned
	through making all the games I have is how to make models for computers. I'm not that great at it, my main weakness is still probably making textures.	</p>
